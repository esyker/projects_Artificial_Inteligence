Question1
Describe the state representation and the operators.

Each state is represented as a list of patients. Each state has different remain waiting times for the patients and different remain Consult Times.


Question 2
Identify the method used for the search algorithm. Justify the choice.

The used method is A*, which is better than blind or uninformed search, since it substantially reduces the branching factor and search time.
Adittionaly if we guarantee that the heuristic function sactisfies a set of properties the search remains complete and optimal. 

Question 3
Does the chosen algorithm guarantee the optimal solution? Justify.

Let h*(N) be the cost of the optimal path from N to a goal node.
The heuristic function h(N) is admissible if: 0 < h(N) < h*(N)
An admissible heuristic function is always optimistic !
A* is complete and optimal
[This result holds if nodes revisiting states are not discarded]

Question 4
Determine the number of generated nodes, the depth of the solution, and the effective branching factor, 
for each one of the example files provided at the course webpage.

The effective branching factor b* is defined by n = 1 + b* + (b*)2 +...+ (b*)d.
