1. Explain how the problem was modelled with a Bayesian network.

The Bayesian network represents both events and time, this is, the events at certain time instances (t).  
To represent an event at time step i the format used is “event#ti”. 
So, for example, in the BN we show the disease covid event at time step 1 with the representation “covid#t1”. 
Since no information was given regarding the diseases, at timestep 0, we considered an initial probability of having any disease (PD) of 50%, since the likelihood of having the disease or not at the beginning is equal if no information is available.
There are two types of nodes : 
•	Diseases 
•	Exams
So in the BN there are certain types of connections or edges between these nodes: 
•	A disease at timestep i-1 is parent to another disease with common symptoms at timestep i.
	This models the probagation probability (PP).
	If the patient had the disease1 at timestep i-1 and disease1 and disease2 have common symptons:
		P(disease1#ti|disease2#ti-1=True,disease1#ti-1=True)=PP 

•	A disease at timestep i-1 is parent to itself at timestep i.
	This models the fact that if the patient does not have the disease at timestep i will not have it at timestep i+1, but if he had it this probability will be 1 if there are no other diseases with common symptons.
	If there are no other disease with common symptons:
		P(disease#ti|disease#ti-1=False,diseases_with_common_symptons=False)=0 and P(disease#ti|disease#ti-1=True,diseases_with_common_symptons=False)=1.

•	Disease at timestep i is parent to an exam at timestep i that measures it.
	This models the exam TPR and FPR. P(exam#ti=F|disease#ti=T)=FPR and P(exam#ti=True|disease=True)=TPR

Imagine two diseases, disease1 and disease2, with common symptons and an exam E1 associated to the disease2.
This is modeled in the Baeysian Network for two timesteps t0 and t1 as:
     	     ______________      ________________
            | disease1#t0  |    | disease2#t0    |       _______
            |______________|    |________________|----->| E1#t0 |
                    | \_______         / |              |_______|
                    |   ______\_______/  |        
                    |  /       \_______  |
                    | /                \ |
             _______v_v____      ______v_v_______
            | disease1#t1  |    | disease2#t1    |       ______
            |______________|    |________________|----->| E1#t1|
                                                        |______|

The evidences utilized to solve the Bayesian Network are the exams results (measures).
The Bayesian Network is solved using inference with variable elimination and the evidences.
The diseases probabilities at all the given timesteps are infered.
In the end, is returned the disease with the highest infered probability, at the last timestep.
